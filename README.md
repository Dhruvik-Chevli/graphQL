# graphQL

My attempt to learning graphQL.

This is the backend for a gaming portal and allows for features such as adding players, games, making friends, purchasing games etc.

When running locally just run ***npm start*** and open ***localhost:8000/playground*** on a web browser which redirects you to a graphQL playground where you can look at further documentation of the API.
